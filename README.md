# Morning-Email-Update-Project-
This project is intended as a morning email update, including a motivational random phrase from various authors, a weather forecast, Twitter trends and Wikipedia recommended random articles. The default location for weather and Twitter trends are London and UK, respectively. Therefore, to change to a different location, a list of location codes from Accuweather is required to obtain weather from a new designated place. Twitter trends are also coded toward the UK. Therefore, a different location code would be required. API keys and location codes are yet to be retrieved from each site.
